# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Notes of the class 
```
1) we should always try to keep the first letter of the function uppercase while creating component. 
```
```
2) While creating file using vitereact we shuld use the extension .jsx and this is not compulsory for the file while using  direct react. 
```
```
3) when importing morethan one line or rendereing then we shoule use the frangment and write the code inside it ex. look at the app.jsx written about the fragment and it's usefullness.
