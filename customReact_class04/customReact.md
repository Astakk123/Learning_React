# Notes of the class 

``` 
1) when we try to create a custom react then we do alot of thing  we create our own rendering method and we call it and

2) we define how shluld it be like which happens in react in behind the scene so we pass a something 

3) When we try to render it in the react then it doesn't work 
the main reason behind it is it is not the render function we have 
defined in the react so it doesn't work because it is customed 

4) to run it we should use the react.createElement where it automatically 
give you the permission to render in the react because it is written like that.

5) Here you can pass the same and get the result because it works behind it
